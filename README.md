# Predisine

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

The traditional way of detecting disease have become insufficient for a serious 
case of ailment.Developing a health system using Machine Learning Algorithm
that can deliver early and faster detection of disease and thus necessary
actions can be taken to cure the disease.

**GOAL**

Our solution **"Predisine"** is a Machine Learning Web based technology 
that is used to detect disease based on symptoms provided by the patient.

**Challenges We Faced**

* During the development and training of the model, we came through a problem that the accuracy of the model was very low due to the inaccurate data encoding, this problem was solved through a better encoding approach where we considered a weighted value of every symptom label and hence boosted the accuracy from 24.35% to 98.69%

* A problem was seen during the prediction phase, as the prediction classes were predefined by the author of the dataset the modelâ€™s performance rigid to a certain extent. Hence, to solve this issue we coded some of our own custom predict functions keeping the dynamics of weighted data labels in consideration, making the predictions more agile and comprehensive

* There are a few existing bugs in the proposed solution which are required to be removed in due time.


**Functionalities**

* We used symptoms dataset using which we have predicted the type of disease 
* Then we have developed a ML model based on the dataset 
* Then we have developed ML Web App using Streamlit which have the integration of ML model
* ML Web App Functionalities :-
    
    * First we have to enter the patient name
    * Then enter atleast 4 symptoms and maximum upto 7 symptoms
    * Then use the predict button to predict the detected disease

**ACCURACY**

Our ML model got an accuracy of 98%

**TECH STACK**



**CONCLUSION**

Thus using this model we can accurately predict the type of corneal ulcers in the eyes
